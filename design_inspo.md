# Design Inspiration Board: The "Heirloom Modern" Aesthetic
This inspiration board captures the "Passionfroot" look—professional, high-energy, and clean—reimagined for a personal family recipe collection. It uses Young Serif to bring a warm, "heritage" feel to the bold, modular layout.

1. The Core Color Story
The palette avoids the "drab" browns often found in recipe sites, opting instead for high-vibrancy "Digital Fruit" tones.

Primary Action Color: A "Zesty Grapefruit" (Vibrant Coral). This is used exclusively for buttons like "Print Recipe" or "Add to Favorites." It signals energy and heat.

The Canvas: "Bleached Flour White" for the main backgrounds, paired with a "Cool Linen" (very light blue-gray) for section dividers. This keeps the site feeling airy and surgical.

The Accent Trio: * Basil Green: A soft, muted pastel green for "Healthy" or "Vegetarian" tags.

Soft Egg Yolk: A pale, creamy yellow for "Baking" or "Breakfast" categories.

Lavender Salt: A pale purple for "Tips & Tricks" or "History" callouts.

2. Structural Elements & Shapes
The "look" is defined by heavy rounding and modularity, making the interface feel like a physical object you can touch.

The "Squircle": Every container—from recipe cards to search bars—uses a deep corner radius (approx. 24px). This removes all "sharpness" from the site, making it feel friendly and safe.

Bento Compartments: Instead of a long scrolling list, information is housed in "compartments" of different sizes. A large square for the hero photo, a thin horizontal rectangle for prep times, and a tall vertical sliver for the ingredient list.

Invisible Borders: Use thin, 1px strokes in a shade just slightly darker than the background (like a light "Parchment" gray) rather than heavy drop shadows.

3. Typography & Pairings
This pairing balances the "old world" weight of family heritage with the "new world" clarity of a modern app.

The Display Font (Young Serif): Used for recipe titles and major section headers. It is heavy, soulful, and rounded. It feels like a vintage cookbook found in a high-end tech office.

The Body Font (Instrument Sans): A clean, modern sans-serif that perfectly matches the "tech" side of the aesthetic. It is highly readable for long ingredient lists and step-by-step instructions.

The Hierarchy: * H1 (Recipe Title): Young Serif, Large, Dark Grey (#1A1A1A).

H2 (Section Headers): Young Serif, Medium, Coral (#FF5C5C).

Body Text: Instrument Sans, Regular, Steel Grey (#4A4A4A).

Captions: Instrument Sans, Bold, All-Caps for metadata (e.g., "PREP TIME: 20 MIN").

4. Imagery & Iconography
This style moves away from "rustic" photography toward "editorial" photography.

The Hero Photos: High-saturation, top-down "flat lay" photography. Ingredients should be organized neatly, not scattered. The lighting should be bright and "clinical-chic."

3D Clay Icons: Instead of flat line icons, use "Claymorphism." Imagine a 3D-rendered, soft-touch wooden spoon, a plump tomato, or a shiny salt shaker.

Data Badges: Treat cooking metrics like "SaaS metrics." Use small pill-shaped badges for "Difficulty: Easy," "Time: 45m," and "Servings: 4," giving the user a sense of "performance data" for the meal.

5. Interaction Feel
The "vibe" of the movement should be snappy and responsive.

Micro-Bounces: When hovering over a recipe card, it should lift slightly and "squish" (a subtle scale-up effect).

Clean Transitions: Page changes shouldn't fade; they should "slide" or "pop" into place, mimicking the fluid feel of a high-end smartphone OS.
